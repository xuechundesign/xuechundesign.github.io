Xuechun is an design student major in Visual Communication Design at RIT. She has passion and yearning on both arts and design so would be a good fit to design position. 

In terms of her working experience, she was interning as a designer at Face++, an artificial intelligence company, doing UI design and visuals for mobile and web products. She also worked on campus as a RA on design in Labs. She collaborates well with colleagues and suit in the diverse environment.
