### Problem

Instrument hires the best people with strong skill sets, but they are not leveraging the efficiently enough to help others growth and accomplish their expansion plans.


### Solution

Create a resources platform for instrument employees to form groups and identify internal and extranet events to assist in leveraging your skills to each other.

### Objective

<div class="row fit">
<div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12">
<br>
<br>
<br>
    From the list of different user groups needs, my primary focus was on providing a tool for employee s<b> to learn additional skills from peers and empower each other. </b>
  </div>
  
  <div class="col-lg-9 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/objective1.png">
  </div>
  
 </div>

<div class="row fit">
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/shape1.png">
    
<h4 style="margin-left:0"> Exploration </h4>

<br>
    Create a way for employees to join different types of groups  to help them get more knowledge and encourage them to share with useful resources
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/shape2.png">
    
<h4 style="margin-left:0"> Promotion </h4>
   <br> 
    Help employees time-management about join events. Allow employees to see if there is any novelty at their company easier.
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/shape3.png">

<h4 style="margin-left:0"> Management </h4>
    <br>
    The INSTRUMENT events are published by different types of interest groups so that employees could find the events' history as soon as possible.
    
  </div>
</div>

### Icon

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/instrument/icon.png">
</div>

I was trying to create a set of the icon based on INSTRUMENT stylish, the <b>clean</b>, <b>linear</b> and <b>easy to read</b> icons. It designed to help users to read quickly with the tiny things so that they can figure out what for next step easier.

### Interface
