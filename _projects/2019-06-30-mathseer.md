## Design Process
### Objective

For <span>different</span> types of people using mathematic formula by tablet, PC or mobile which with the electrical pen.

### Form and Feature

Considering with different **groups** of people in learning math.

To research many types of competitive products in nowadays. 

To combine with technology up-to-date, meeting the needs of the practicability of interaction.

Software’s usability should be bonded with whole design system. Both of the function and web design should be intuitive and explicit.







### Problems found in old Min

- Recognition take times
- Multiple stroked symbol
- Ability to fix unwanted recognition
- ...

### What we could borrow from AutoDraw

- Bounding box to show reco area
- Always show candidates
- Keep strokes until user pick one

### Design Goals

- Continuously Drawing
- Quick Feedback
- Incremental Recognition
- Easy to fix unwanted result

### Sketch
Here are some of my design sketches which is start from mobile first. The initial idea of is to achieve cross-platform functionality.
But I suggested the tablet is more practical as the product showing and using. So I restart to build this wireframe as well for our team.

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:
