As a Research Assistant Work at [Document and Pattern Recognition Lab@RIT](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/)

## What we're going to do?
#### Existing Problems
To search resources in the Internet,not only students, but also mathematicians, they need to **remember and type** so many **complicated formula** by **shortcuts** on the **keyboard**.
<br>
<br>

 
#### Form and Feature
  
<div class="row fit">
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/mathseer/feature/1.png">
    
<h6 style="margin-left:0"> Hand-writting recogniton </h6>

<br>
    Users can write formula in the screen, searching engine page will show all of the resources about it directly    
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/mathseer/feature/2.png">
    
<h6 style="margin-left:0"> Image-recogniton </h6>
   <br> 
   Taking a picture or insert an image, the system will capture and recognize all of the formulae in this page
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/mathseer/feature/3.png">

<h6 style="margin-left:0"> Formula Deck </h6>
    <br>
    <br>
    Saving the formula you searched, use it next time drag it out
        
  </div>

#### Problems found in old Min
[Try Old version](http://saskatoon.cs.rit.edu/min/)

![](/images/mathseer/bad.png)
- Lack the design system
- Multiple stroked symbol
- Ability to fix unwanted recognition
- ...
<br>
<br>

#### What we could borrow from AutoDraw
[Try AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/)

- Bounding box to show reco area
- Always show candidates
- Keep strokes until user pick one

#### About Our Design Goals
Creating a mathematic formula searching engine to find an easy way for different types of people in learning math. 

Our product is supporting user write formula by the electrical pen and take pictures to recognize it.
Both of the function and UI design should be intuitive and explicit. Fixing the unwanted result should be easy.

  
## üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
Besides under the guidance of Prof. Zanibbi, there‚Äôre four more engineers deliberate over the UX questions before I design for it. I appreciate all of yours' help in here!

### Let's have a try

#### 1.The Input Way -- Writting

<center>
  <video width="60%" controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="/images/mathseer/video/onlyType.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

The candidate will show simultaneously as you write on the canvas

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### 2. Correction Bar

<center>
  <video width="60%" controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="/images/mathseer/video/type2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

###### When your hand-writting is illegible
The similar formulas as you input will be in the below, if the candidate showing is not what you need, find it from here!

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### 3. Another Input Way -- Capture Screen

<center>
  <video width="60%" controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="/images/mathseer/video/onlyCamera.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### 4. Search Engine Result Page

<center>
  <video width="60%" controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="/images/mathseer/video/SERP2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>
 
Re-editing query (formula or text) would fold the SERP and revoke the canvas back.
(* SERP is faked with Google.com screenshot)

#### 5. Formula Deck

  <video width="60%" controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="/images/mathseer/video/formulaDeck.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>
 
Re-editing query (formula or text) would fold the SERP and revoke the canvas back.

### Sketch
Here are some of my design sketches which is start from mobile first. The initial idea of is to achieve cross-platform functionality.
But I suggested the tablet is more practical as the product showing and using. So I restart to build this wireframe as well for our team.
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/mathseer/sketch/sketch1.png">
	<img src="/images/mathseer/sketch/sketch2.png">
	<img src="/images/mathseer/sketch/sketch3.png">
	
</div>

### Breakaway

During the design iterations and getting feedback from our team, I found out that there is a lot to consider when designing for the handwriting recognition and image-recognize platform.

First of all, I need to think a different formula has different weight and height. I'm going to try different types of mathematics formula as I searched, to fix them in the box container. And then I need to figure out potential problems when user use it as much as possible, such as using the function of self-association, to correct mistake formula that user drawed. 

To find a method to make UI elements looks well-organized, I leant a lot from **Google Material Design**
