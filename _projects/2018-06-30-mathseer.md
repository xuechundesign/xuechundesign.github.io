As a Research Assistant Work at [Document and Pattern Recognition Lab@RIT](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/)

## What we're going to do?
#### Existing Problems
To search resources in the Internet,not only students, but also mathematicians, they need to **remember and type** so many **complicated formula** by **shortcuts** on the **keyboard**.
<br>
<br>

 
#### Form and Feature
  
<div class="row fit">
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/mathseer/feature/1.png">
    
<h6 style="margin-left:0"> Hand-writting recogniton </h6>

<br>
    Users can write formula in the screen, searching engine page will show all of the resources about it directly    
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/mathseer/feature/2.png">
    
<h6 style="margin-left:0"> Image-recogniton </h6>
   <br> 
   Taking a picture or insert an image, the system will capture and recognize all of the formulae in this page
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12">
    <img src="/images/mathseer/feature/3.png">

<h6 style="margin-left:0"> Formula Deck </h6>
    <br>
    <br>
    Saving the formula you searched, use it next time drag it out
        
  </div>
</div>

#### Problems found in old Min
[Try Old version](http://saskatoon.cs.rit.edu/min/)

![](/images/mathseer/bad.png)
- Lack the design system
- Multiple stroked symbol
- Ability to fix unwanted recognition
- ...
<br>
<br>

#### What we could borrow from AutoDraw
[Try AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/)

![](/images/mathseer/competitive.png)
- Bounding box to show reco area
- Always show candidates
- Keep strokes until user pick one
<br>
<br>

#### Our Design Goals
Creating a formula searching engine to find an easy way for different types of people in learning math. Our product supporting user write formula by the electrical pen and take pictures recognize it.

Both of the function and UI design should be intuitive and explicit.It should be easy to fix unwanted result.

Besides under the guidance of Prof. Zanibbi, there're four more engineers deliberate over the UX questions before I design for it.

### MAINPAGE

#### A glance to know the Home Screen

### Let's have a try

#### The Input Way --  1. Writting

<center>
  <video width="60%" controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="/images/mathseer/video/onlyType.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

Choosing your favorite color for functionality or just fun! 
The beautiful MathSeer Blue is chosen by default ;)

#### 2. Capture

<center>
  <video width="60%" controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="/images/mathseer/video/onlyCamera.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

#### 3. Search Engine Result Page

<center>
  <video width="60%" controls autoplay loop>
    <source src="/images/mathseer/video/SERP.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>
 
Re-editing query (formula or text) would fold the SERP and revoke the canvas back.
(* SERP is faked with Google.com screenshot)

### ADD FORMULA

Searching as much formulas in a single query as you want.

##### Formula Recognition Result
Continously recognizing users’ hand-writing.
##### Auto Completion
Offering search suggestions based on uncompleted queries.

### FIRE SEARCH

The “Search Engine Result Page” panel will slide in from the side.

### Font & Color
Getting color from the MathSeer ’s icon theme contrasting color, the BLUE (4084D1) & ORANGE (FD8423)

</div>

### Sketch
Here are some of my design sketches which is start from mobile first. The initial idea of is to achieve cross-platform functionality.
But I suggested the tablet is more practical as the product showing and using. So I restart to build this wireframe as well for our team.

</div>



<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:
