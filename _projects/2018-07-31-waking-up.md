### Is that also your morning?

It is hard to <b> get out of your whole night sleep mode</b>. 
<br>
I still **have lots of stuff to do**
<br>
I **don't have a good mood** in dealing with these **daily-routines**
<br>
I always forget this or that, cause the **time is always in the rush**
<br>
The **living atmosphere** is **not motivated** and **humanized** enough for me to start a new day.

### Improve it !

Everyone has personal different schedule and time-management in the morning

My solution is to build a connection with all of the smart home devices, and asking them to assist for your **daily morning routine** together ! 

The smart devices could be the **light, water boiler, google home, bathtub, oven, microwave**...  Anything you need in the morning, they can prepare for **methodic and orderly as your morning routine**

### Process

To meet the users' needs, I embarked on a series of UX strategy and prototyping test. Together, I created a user flow which is based on user research to improve user experience.

It could be depart from three part, **"Homepage for new user"**, **"Modified the morning routine for tomorrow"** and  **"Add a New Routine"**
