> “A simple way for students know their roommates' whereabouts can help save time and be convenient”

## Inspiration Comes From

This is my first time living with three roommates, and each of us comes from different country. In this <b>culture diverse</b> living situation,everyone is <b>unfamiliar</b> with each other's daily routine and habits.
<br> 
<br> 
Sometimes others disturb me only cause of I'm too quiet at home but they don't know. Besides, we also confuse about is there anyone at home give us a hand to pick the our package.

## Problem & Solution

Every roommate has their own schedule where they disturb each other's daily routine. 

###### "I always don't know if I can make any noise at my room, cause I don't know if they are at home real-time."

###### "I want to go to the shuttle to the house with her together, but it's a waste of time due to I need to wait for her reply."

###### "It's embarrassed about knocking at door for asking if they are here every time."


I was trying to help the roommates can get help with  each other based on knowing the presence of one another by this function.
Connecting with roommates in order to save time, provide convenient and improve life proficiency.

## Viusal 
I was trying to use bold but clean color system to build this interface more clearly for users. As this product is designed for students. To show the teenagers personality I create the illustrations of **HOUSES SELECTED** , **EMOJIS STATUS** or **AVATAR** to create the energetic and young stylish into the design
