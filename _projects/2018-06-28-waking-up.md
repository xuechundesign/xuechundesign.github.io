<p class="intro-text"> 

<b>Waking up</b> app is designed to provide sorts of choices for users to control their home smart devices in the future. Such as bathtubs, home audios, kitchen utensils, etc. This auto-system will decrease users' morning laziness time in case oversleep and to build a humanized and comfortable get-up-atmosphere. The product goal is trying to improve living efficiency and shorten the time before users prepare to go out.

### Problem Definition

It is hard to open your eyes and get out of your whole night sleep mode, refreshing quickly to close your alarm. In such situation, many people just close it insensibly and think we can safely assume that “I just take a nap in one minute”. Unfortunately, most of us overslept or delay too much time.

The second reason of that is the living atmosphere is not motivated and humanized enough for people to start a new day.

### Process

To meet the users' needs, I embarked on a series of UX strategy and prototyping test. Together, I created a user flow which is based on user research to improve user experience.

It could be depart from three part, **"Homepage for new user"**, **"Modified the morning routine for tomorrow"** and  **"Add a New Routine"**
