### ICON SET DESIGN

Here's a part of internship project to design icon set for Face++ official website.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon1.png">
   <img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon2.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon3.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon4.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon5.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon6.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon7.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon8.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon9.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon10.png"> 	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon11.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon12.png">
   			
	</div>

Based on existing main dark color <span style="color:#000E2B">(#000E2B)</span> as background to add scientific but vivid style,in the meanwhile express the similar meaning for abstract business events.

To emphasis the sense of scientific, I choosed different blue style and combined with purple to balance the banner style more suit for website

### BANNER DESIGN

Here's parts of banner design which are created for face++, both used in web and mobile devices - all with the goal of elevating the product's digital presence.

	<img src="/images/facepp/5face-merging-API.png">
	<img src="/images/facepp/6faceID.png">
</div>

I worked iteratively with content, brand and marketing teams to identify core pieces of the site and create an extensible visual system that could be used both in web and mobile again and again.
