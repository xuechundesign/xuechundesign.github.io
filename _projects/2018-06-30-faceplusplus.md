### <span style="color:#00A4E2">+ </span> ICON SET DESIGN

Here's another part of internship project to design icon set for Face++ official website.

<br>
<br>
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon1.png">
   <img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon2.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon3.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon4.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon5.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon6.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon7.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon8.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon9.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon10.png"> 	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon11.png">
   	<img src="/images/facepp/icon/icon12.png">
   			
	</div>

Based on existing main dark color <span style="color:#000E2B">(#000E2B)</span> as background to add scientific but vivid style,in the meanwhile express the similar meaning for abstract business events.

To emphasis the sense of scientific, I choosed different blue style and combined with purple to balance the banner style more suit for website
