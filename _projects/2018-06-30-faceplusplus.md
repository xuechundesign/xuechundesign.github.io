## Icons 

Since I just come to Face++, the first project my visual mentor asked me to do is drawing a set of icon for website. They don't like the old icon version serves for their web.

##### Existing Problem

To me, these icons are not consistent with each other.In the first image, these lines width are bold, but the second image's icons' line are much thinner.Besides, the stylish are totally different.

I was trying to enhance scientific feelings for icon element.
Firstly, to make the system more creative and vivid, I combined the line shape and the light blue shadow as overlapping. And each icon I add **"+"** symbol to work in concert with our brand --- Face++

There're many icon need to showing face element.Such as "Unlimited face quality", "Abuntant face attributes" and " Abundant mood recognition". So I referenced APPLE's face-id logo, draw it in a different way by changing it's nose orientation;)

The gradient dot with **"+"** works well with the series icon, it makes the icon more like a image not only boring line.

I selected these three blue color to make it works like AI style. Cause people always imagine the future stuff in blue style.

Based on existing main dark color <span style="color:#000E2B">(#000E2B)</span> as background to add scientific but vivid style,in the meanwhile express the similar meaning for abstract business events.

To emphasis the sense of scientific, I choosed different blue style and combined with purple to balance the banner style more suit for website

### Banners 


*I worked iteratively with content, brand and marketing teams to create an **extensible** visual system that works well with our company.* *-- "SCI Jan 2010"*



I worked iteratively with content, brand and marketing teams to create an extensible visual system that works well with our company.
Here's parts of banner design which are created for Face++, both used in web and mobile devices - all with the goal of elevating the product's digital presence.

### UX & UI

#### Live Face Recognition Setup

**Live Face Recognition**, a.k.a. Liveness Detection, is increasinly important in AI area, where traditional face recognition could suffer from faked faces and result in insecurities. This is especially important for government departments like public security organization, and vulnerable corporations such as banks and big companies.


This project is to provide a setup process to our clients using this service to present to their users. It needs to take photos of users' ID cards and to record videos both as samples for future verification. My work on this project is based on my mentors existing works on user flows and wireframes, and my duty is to help designing the UIs feeling more reliable yet more approachable to the broad variety of user bases of this project.

Making UIs reliable is relatively straightforward. I made it looks formal and official, provided a clean userpath, and added our company logo as backing. However, _how to make it more intuitive for more users?_ **A picture is worth a thousand words!** I decided to create a bunch of friendly illustrations added to the UI as a visual guidance throughout the whole setup process. 

Here are them!

#### Mobile Web Redesign 

To make mobile web interaction and visual more intuitive, I redesigned and optimized a part of it. Combining some AI style illustrations to make it works better on the mobile.

	<img src="/images/facepp/ui/ui1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/facepp/ui/ui4.jpg">
	<img src="/images/facepp/ui/ui5.jpg">
</div>

I analysised the shortcomes of existing mobile version, the interaction way is too deep, sometimes user need explore tap many times to get the entrance of what they need.
