## About the Project

This project is a hypothetical exploration to design a transit diagram for the city of Rochester. While there is currently no subway in Rochester, there was The Rochester Industrial and Rapid Transit Railway, more commonly known as the Rochester Subway, a light rail rapid transit line that ran from 1927 to 1956. Rochester is the smallest city in America to build and abandon a subway system.

## Determination
- scope of system (how far north, east, south and west)
number of lines and exchange points
- scale (degree of distortion to accommodate detail and to be efficient)
- number and names of stops on the lines
- references to townships, places, locations, destinations
- shape, structure and configuration of your transit diagram
- landmarks, river, lake, thruway, etc.
