## Ideation Comes From

This is my first experience living with three roommates, and each of us comes from different country. In this <b>culture diverse</b> living situation, everyone is <b>unfamiliar</b> with each other's daily routine and habits.
<br> 
<br> 
Sometimes others disturb me only cause of I'm too quiet at home but **they don't know**. Actually I just lay on my bed and don't want to get up to let them know.

Besides, we also confuse about is there anyone at home **give us a hand** to pick our package or **take a free-ride** for us to the market together.

## Problem & Solution

Every roommate has their own schedule where they disturb each other's daily routine. 

###### "I always don't know if I can make any noise at my room, cause I don't know if they are at home real-time."

###### "I want to go to the shuttle to the house with her together, but it's a waste of time due to I need to wait for her reply."

###### "I don't have a car, but I need someone pick me to market if they are free ."

###### "It's embarrassed about knocking at door for asking if they are here every time."

###### "..."

I was trying to help the roommates can get help with  each other based on knowing the presence of one another by this function.
Connecting with roommates in order to save time, provide life convenient and enhance roommates'relationship .

## UI Stage 
I was trying to use bold but clean color system to build this interface more clearly for users. As this product is designed for students. To show the teenagers personality I create the illustrations of **HOUSES SELECTED** , **EMOJIS STATUS** or **AVATAR** to create the energetic and young stylish into the design

Hey! I'm Xuechun, it's my first time using DORMIE app, I <b>join a dorm circle</b> by a <b>code</b> that Namhee created before.


<br>
### <span style="color:#D8D8D8"> 2. LOCATION SHARING  <span>

  <video width="70%" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source src="/images/dormie/dormie-flow2.min.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

###### LEFT SIDE: 
Adjusting the sequence of the <b> Place Cards </b>, I prefer to set <b>"HOME"</b> as the first place in homepage.  <b> > </b>  What if I don’t want to share my geolocation anytime ? It’s pretty easy to turn off whenever and it will not let others know:)  <b> ></b> 
<br>
###### RIGHT SIDE:
To make this experienve beautiful, each place need to select a <b>home illustration</b> as a sign

<br>
### <span style="color:#D8D8D8"> 3. CHECK LOCATION<span> 
![](/images/dormie/dormie-flow3.png)

<center>
  <video width="80%" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source src="/images/dormie/dormie-flow3.min.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

At present, it's convenient to know the Juile and Namhee is at HOME, Andrea and I is at SCHOOL, and no one is at WEGMANS

<br>
### <span style="color:#D8D8D8"> 4. CREATE STATUS <span> 
![](/images/dormie/dormie-flow4.png)

<center>
  <video width="80%" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source src="/images/dormie/dormie-flow4.min.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

Today, I baked some biscuits,  so I would like to share with them together! And I got Namhee is sleeping right now. This function helps roommates to know more about each other's schedule easily. 

<br>
### <span style="color:#D8D8D8">5. INTELLIGENT CHAT <span> 
![](/images/dormie/dormie-flow5.png)

<center>
  <video width="80%" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source src="/images/dormie/dormie-flow5.min.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

It intelligently provides the common sentences for roommates! I don't need to type for a long while anymore! And I also could back-up other sentences for next time.
