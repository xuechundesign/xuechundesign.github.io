    <h4>Hi, there ðŸ‘‹</h4>
    <ul>
   
Currently, I'm doing my 2019 summer internship at Yahoo! (under Version Media) as a product designer working on new features and visuals for our new [Yahoo Play](https://mobile.yahoo.com/play) app. I am also happy to be one of the holiday doodler messing up our logo on [Yahoo.com](http://yahoo.com) ;)
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
I'm going to graduate in December 2019 for my 2-years MFA in Visual Communication Design with a major focus on UI/UX interaction design and a minor on illustration design at Rochester Institute of Technology. 

    
    <br>
    <br>
    
I found myself fascinated by making the interaction more user friendly and creating visuals and illustrations for digital products. That were the moments I realized that I'm going to be a product illustrator / designer in this world.
